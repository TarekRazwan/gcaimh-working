# Ther-Assist internal documentation

This documentation is intended for the SUNY Ther-Assist team during initial project development.

.gitignore for other branches should be updated to ignore this folder until it is ready for general use.

# sub-folders

project - documents at a project level scope, anything that documents sequence for multiple components that do not relate to a single execution sequence through modules

therapy_analysis - documents for the therapy_analysis function (backend entrypoint for gemini calls), including interactions that are integrated into the therapy analysis as well (setup_services...)

wip_docs - docs that may eventually be useful during dissemination
